# SOLID-Design-principle

The SOLID principles are five design principles that help create maintainable, flexible, and robust object-oriented software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and form the foundation of clean code architecture.
SOLID is an acronym for:

S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open/Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle


This repository provides an explanation of each principle as well as code snippets in java to demonstrate them
