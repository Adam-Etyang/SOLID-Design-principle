### Definition
>
"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification."

The Open/Closed Principle means you should be able to add new functionality to your code without changing existing, working code.

#### Open for Extension
You can add new functionality
You can extend behavior
You can introduce new features
You can adapt to new requirements

#### Closed for Modification
Existing code remains unchanged
Working functionality stays stable
No risk of breaking existing features
Tested code doesn't need retesting
